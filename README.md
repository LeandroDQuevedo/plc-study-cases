# PLC Projects â€“ Ladder & Structured Text

A collection of automation projects using **Ladder Diagram (LD)** and **Structured Text (ST)** based on the **IEC 61131-3** standard. These examples are intended for learning, experimentation, and small automation tasks using **CODESYS** and **e!Cockpit-compatible** PLCs.

## ðŸ’¡ About

This repository contains code samples and mini-projects developed primarily in **CODESYS**, written in both **Ladder (LD)** and **Structured Text (ST)** formats.

For **e!Cockpit**, only compiled or exported files (`.clp`) are included for direct upload to compatible WAGO PLCs. The source code remains in CODESYS for easier editing and simulation.
